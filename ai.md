Look at my homepage: https://walter-a-jablonowski.github.io

This is my personal homepage that I use as a developer for getting jobs and acquiring small orders. Please create a much more visually stunning and functional homepage using the power of AI. Be creative and do your best.

General design:

- My personal "theme" for the design is: "cool developer"
- Preferred colors: black, white, orange-gold, red-tinged colors, appealing greys, maybe yellow if needed
- Maybe use (if needed): yellow
- Colors to avoid: blue, green, purple, pink, brown
- You have full creative freedom with the layout, styling, and structure
- To make the site stand out and support my sales efforts, feel free to use:
  - animations
  - diagrams
  - color gradients
  - third party interactive elements e.g. maps
  - anything you think would enhance the site’s appeal
- You can modify, add, or remove content, and change the order as needed to improve presentation and impact
- If necessary, make stunning SVGs or create or source new images
- Select beautiful fonts that align with the "cool developer" theme
- Keep content compact and organized, avoiding long vertical scrolling
- Ensure the website is responsive and looks great on all devices

Misc:

- SEO: Improve the page for SEO and AI-based search engines
- Legal content
  - In addition to the homepage, create a privacy policy page that complies with DSGVO
  - Retain the existing text from my imprint page for legal reasons but feel free to alter the design
  - Keep the existing text for the cookies popup, which reads: "I don't use cookies. By using this site, you accept technically necessary third-party terms and cookies. Details see privacy."
- If you decide to add a contact form, it doesn’t need to be functional for now; it’s just for design purposes

Technical Specifications:

- Use HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript only
- Place styles and JavaScript in separate files
- Indent all code with 2 spaces
