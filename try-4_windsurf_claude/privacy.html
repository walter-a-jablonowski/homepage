    <h1>Privacy Policy (Datenschutzerklärung)</h1>

    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> April 2025</p>

    <p>We take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations (particularly the GDPR) and this privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Controller</h2>
    <p>
      The responsible party (controller) for data processing on this website is:
      <br><br>
      <strong>[Your Full Name / Company Name]</strong><br>
      <strong>[Your Street Address]</strong><br>
      <strong>[Your Postal Code and City]</strong><br>
      <strong>[Your Country, e.g., Germany]</strong><br><br>
      Email: <strong>[Your Email Address, e.g., walter.a.jablonowski@gmail.com]</strong><br>
      <!-- Add Phone Number if applicable -->
      <!-- Add Commercial Register Number if applicable -->
    </p>
    <p>The controller is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).</p>

    <h2>2. General Information and Mandatory Information</h2>

    <h3>Data Protection</h3>
    <p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.</p>
    <p>If you use this website, various personal data will be collected. Personal data is data with which you can be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.</p>
    <p>We point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when communicating by email) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>

    <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
    <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. An informal message by email to us is sufficient. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>

    <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
    <p>In the event of breaches of data protection law, the data subject has the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority. The competent supervisory authority for data protection issues is the state data protection commissioner of the federal state in which our company is based. A list of data protection officers and their contact details can be found at the following link: <a href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html</a>.</p>

    <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
    <p>You have the right to have data which we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to yourself or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you require the direct transfer of data to another controller, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.</p>

    <h3>Information, Blocking, Deletion</h3>
    <p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient and the purpose of the data processing and, if necessary, a right to correction, blocking or deletion of this data. You can contact us at any time at the address given in the imprint if you have further questions on the subject of personal data.</p>

    <h3>Right to Object to Advertising Emails</h3>
    <p>We hereby object to the use of contact data published in the context of the imprint obligation to send advertising and information materials not expressly requested. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam emails.</p>


    <h2>3. Data Collection on This Website</h2>

    <h3>Server Log Files</h3>
    <p>The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Browser type and browser version</li>
      <li>Operating system used</li>
      <li>Referrer URL (the previously visited page)</li>
      <li>Host name of the accessing computer</li>
      <li>Time of the server request</li>
      <li>IP address (may be anonymized by the hoster)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is not merged with other data sources. The collection of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the technically error-free presentation and optimization of their website – for this purpose, the server log files must be collected.</p>

    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <p>As stated in the cookie notice, this website itself does not intentionally use cookies that store personal data or are used for tracking user behavior across sites. Technically necessary data processing might occur due to embedded third-party services or the hosting platform itself (see below). Should we implement features that require cookies in the future, we will update this policy and obtain necessary consent.</p>

    <h3>Contact Form / Email Contact</h3>
    <p>The contact form on this website is currently for design purposes only and does not transmit data. If you contact us by email, the information you provide will be stored for the purpose of processing your request and for possible follow-up questions.</p>
    <p>The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, if your request is related to the performance of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of inquiries addressed to us (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). We will not share this information without your consent.</p>
    <p>The data you send to us via contact requests remains with us until you request deletion, revoke your consent to storage, or the purpose for data storage ceases to apply (e.g., after your request has been processed). Mandatory statutory provisions – especially retention periods – remain unaffected.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <h3>Google Fonts (Local Hosting Recommended)</h3>
    <p>This site uses web fonts provided by Google for the uniform display of fonts. Currently, these fonts are loaded directly from Google servers. When you access a page, your browser establishes a direct connection with Google servers. Google thereby learns that our website has been accessed via your IP address.</p>
    <p>The use of Google Fonts is based on our legitimate interest in a uniform and appealing presentation of our online presence (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). Google LLC, based in the USA, is certified for the US-European data protection agreement "Privacy Shield", which guarantees compliance with the data protection level applicable in the EU. However, for enhanced data privacy, consider hosting the fonts locally if technically feasible.</p>
    <p>Further information about Google Fonts can be found at <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq</a> and in Google's privacy policy: <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a>.</p>

    <h3>GitHub Pages</h3>
    <p>This website is hosted by GitHub Pages, a service provided by GitHub, Inc., 88 Colin P Kelly Jr St, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. When you visit our website, GitHub may collect log data such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information, search terms, and cookie information. This processing is based on our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) in providing a reliable and secure hosting platform.</p>
    <p>GitHub is also certified under the Privacy Shield agreement and thus offers a guarantee to comply with European data protection law. For more details, please refer to GitHub's privacy statement: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement</a>.</p>

    <!-- Add other third-party services if applicable (e.g., Map services, Analytics, CDNs) -->
    <!-- Example: OpenStreetMap -->
    <!--
    <h3>OpenStreetMap</h3>
    <p>We use the map service OpenStreetMap (OSM). The provider is the OpenStreetMap Foundation. To use the functions of OpenStreetMap, it is necessary to store your IP address. This information is usually transferred to an OSM server and stored there. The provider of this site has no influence on this data transfer. The use of OpenStreetMap is in the interest of an appealing presentation of our online offers and an easy findability of the places specified by us on the website. This constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.</p>
    <p>More information can be found in the OpenStreetMap privacy policy: <a href="https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>5. Rights of the Data Subject</h2>
    <p>You have the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Right to information</li>
        <li>Right to correction or deletion</li>
        <li>Right to restriction of processing</li>
        <li>Right to object to processing</li>
        <li>Right to data portability</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You also have the right to complain to a data protection supervisory authority about the processing of your personal data by us.</p>

    <h2>6. Right to Object (Art. 21 GDPR)</h2>
    <p><strong>You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning you which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) GDPR, including profiling based on those provisions. The respective legal basis for processing can be found in this privacy policy. If you object, we will no longer process your personal data concerned unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims (Objection according to Art. 21 (1) GDPR).</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Where personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning you for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. If you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, the personal data will no longer be processed for such purposes (Objection according to Art. 21 (2) GDPR).</strong></p>

    <h2>7. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to adapt this privacy policy so that it always complies with the current legal requirements or to implement changes to our services in the privacy policy, e.g., when introducing new services. The new privacy policy will then apply for your return visit.</p>
